## 2. PROJECTS COLLECTION (src/content/projects/*.json)

For EACH work experience entry, extract:

```json
{
  "slug": "kebab-case-company-name-yyyy",
  "clientName": "Company Name",
  "displayName": null, // or masked name if confidential
  "role": "Job Title",
  "startDate": "YYYY-MM",
  "endDate": "YYYY-MM" or "Present",
  "engagementType": "Permanent" or "Contract",
  "workMode": "Remote" or "Hybrid" or "Onsite",
  "teamSize": number or null,
  "location": "City, Country",
  "isConfidential": false, // true for NDA-bound clients
  "isFeatured": true/false, // mark top 5-6 as featured
  "isDraft": false,
  "companyDescription": "Brief company description",
  "techStack": ["Tech1", "Tech2", ...],
  "skills": [
    { "name": "Skill Name", "rating": 1-10 } // PROJECT-SPECIFIC depth
  ],
  "achievements": ["Achievement 1", "Achievement 2", ...],
  "projectReference": "URL if available"
}
```

### SKILL RATING GUIDELINES (Project-Specific Depth)
- 9-10: Primary technology, architectural decisions, mentoring others
- 7-8: Deep hands-on implementation, complex features
- 5-6: Moderate usage, standard implementations
- 3-4: Supporting technology, light usage
- 1-2: Minimal exposure, awareness level

### UNION RULE
When multiple resumes describe the same project with different details:
- UNION all achievements (deduplicate)
- UNION all tech stack items
- Take the MAXIMUM skill rating for overlapping skills
- Prefer the more detailed description
